AJAX and XHR Introduction:
    Most Async code we work with will be a part of an API or library
    
    XMLHttpRequest & Fetch

    There are few ways to work with Async Code:
    i)Callbacks,
    ii)Promises,
    iii)Async/Await

    Async requests should be done in the background and no page reload or refresh should happen when we are fetching the data...

XMLHttpRequest Object:
    API(Application programming interface - a way for a website to talk to other areas) in the form of an Object
    Provided by the browsers JS environment
    can work with data other than XML(JSON,plain text)

    JSON data format: Standard format in which we receive data from different websites...
    JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)

    we always need to convert JSON to normal JavaScript to work with it

    let user = {name:"Alan",age:20}; //remember this?
    
    IN JSON:
    
    let user = {"name":"Alan","age":20} // What is the difference between this and previous???
