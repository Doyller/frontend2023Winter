Full stack developers?? Efficient in both front-end and back-end of applications!

Front-end Technologies: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT...

MERN:MongoDB, Express JS, React, Node.js
MEAN:MongoDB, Express JS, Angular, Node.js

REACT!
A JavaScript library for building User Interfaces
[HTML, CSS, JavaScript]

    Very intuitive way to develop highly responsive user interfaces....
    It gives us divide and rule of application ...[separate concerns -- the application will have independent areas which we can easily debug or work on...]
    It gives us the ability to develop "SPA" (Single page applications) -- SELLING POINT
    (index.html, history.html,about.html,contact.html) in HTML...
    In react we will ONLY HAVE on html page that will serve the complete applicaiton or all the pages....
    How react acheives this? BY using "COMPONENTS"

WHAT WE NEED TO RUN REACT APPLCATIONS:
    1. VSC (YEs)
    2. Node JS 
    3. create React application..

1. Components
2. Props
3. State Variables...





General Structure of React App:

index.html is the page that runs - it has id = root div inside it...
index.js access the id "root" renders a "COMPONENT" App by accessing the App.js component....
App.js is the "MAIN" component that is running while react application runs....


1. Components:
    A reusable dynamic area on the page that gets loaded automatically without refreshing the page....

    Two types:
    i)Function Components
    ii)Class Components

    1.Function Components:
    A fucntion component is just like a normal JS function ...but it returns JSX(JavaScript Extension )[JSX is a code mix of HTML,CSS and JavaScript]
    Its name should start with a capital letter (ALWAYS)

     <div className="App">
      <h1>Welcome {name.toUpperCase()}!!!</h1>
      <h1>My First React App</h1>
      <p>This is my first application in React - React is Fun!</p>
    </div>

    Fragments JSX:
    Fragments start with <> and ends with </>... and they wrap around all the compoenents but DONOT produce any code for themselves..


      <h1>First Component!</h1>
      <h2>Welcome {name}!</h2>
      {loading ? (
        <h4>Loading....</h4>
      ) : (
        <h2>You are welcome {name.toUpperCase()}</h2>
      )}
