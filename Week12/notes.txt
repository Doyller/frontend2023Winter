REACT!
A JavaScript library for building User Interfaces
[HTML, CSS, JavaScript]

    Very intuitive way to develop highly responsive user interfaces....
    It gives us divide and rule of application ...[separate concerns -- the application will have independent areas which we can easily debug or work on...]
    It gives us the ability to develop "SPA" (Single page applications) -- SELLING POINT
    (index.html, history.html,about.html,contact.html) in HTML...
    In react we will ONLY HAVE on html page that will serve the complete applicaiton or all the pages....
    How react acheives this? BY using "COMPONENTS"

WHAT WE NEED TO RUN REACT APPLCATIONS:
    1. VSC (YEs)
    2. Node JS 
    3. create React application..

1. Components
2. Props
3. State Variables...


1. Components:
    A reusable dynamic area on the page that gets loaded automatically without refreshing the page....


General Structure of React App:

index.html is the page that runs - it has id = root div inside it...
index.js access the id "root" renders a "COMPONENT" App by accessing the App.js component....
App.js is the "MAIN" component that is running while react application runs....
