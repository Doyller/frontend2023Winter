WEEK10- DOM Programming Continuation!

We started DOM in Week7, now continuing and learning some new skills related to it! See Week7 folder's feb14.html and feb16.html for reference. 

Let's start something from previous parts and improve it here!
    1. Make a function to change url by considering an array of links
    2. Now let's use event to take out more information, and try to update in real time the information on our web page. 
    3. Bring all the links from the js file containing array and make unordered list and add all the values here in bullets.
    4. Use debug keyword to know what is going on actually in code.
    5. Use setTimeout() & setInterval() functions for some browser events.
