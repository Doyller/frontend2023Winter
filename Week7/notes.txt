CSS Grid: After Sprint! Discuss

DOM: Document Object Model
    API (Application Programming Interface)-something that allows two applications to talk to each other...
    That enables communication between HTML,CSS AND Javascript!

How DOM works:
    When we load an HTML document, the browser makes a DOM Tree of it..
    The element are called "Nodes"
    The text is called "text nodes"...

DOM has few steps:
    1. Finding the reference of the element that we want to work on...
        i)document.getElementById("");  .// we put id in quotations... 
        ii) document.querySelector(selector)
            a) id selector ( always use # with id)
            b) class selector (always use . with class name to access)
            c) tag selector ( provide the tag name as selector)
        iii) document.querySelectorAll(selector)
            it will return the arrray of all nodes referfenced by the selector.
    2. Making changes or reading contents of elements in the tree contents...
        i) .innerText.. (normal text the tags elements will also appear BUT NOT RENDERED...)
        ii) .innerHTML...(the real HTML inside the element will come out.. and rendered when it is set....)

    3. Creating, adding and removing elemetns in the DOM Tree...
        i) document.createElement("img"); ... ti will create a new img element, now we need to append it .. so we can append it anywhere in the body by accessing that partcular area....
    4. Run code in response to the events triggered by the user, browser, or other parts of the code...
        Events: it might include 
            i)user actions( like clicking a button, moving the mouse ,pressing a key , changing tabs etc etc...)
            ii)browser initiated actions (timers, messages from background process , reports from sensors etc...)
    
    We attach events with different elements and run function against any events triggered by those elemtns....
        addEventListener(eventname,function);



let myDiv = document.querySelector("#part1");

myDiv.addEventListener("dblclick", function () {
  let newPic = document.createElement("img");
  newPic.src = "./images/car.jpeg";
  newPic.alt = "Unsplah picture";
  newPic.width = "300";
  newPic.id = "myCar";
  myDiv.appendChild(newPic);

  document.querySelector("#para1").innerText = "Did you like my old car???";
});


NOTES FOR BOOK LIBRARY PROJECT:

//console.log(myForm); //always console.log..your every step, so that you are always confirmed that things going in right direction...



 //   row.innerHTML = "<td>" + t + "</td><td>" + a + "</td><td>" + i + "</td>";
